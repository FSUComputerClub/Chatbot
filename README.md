Instructions to get the Chatterbot working
Step 1. First make sure you are using a version of Python 3 or newer. To check your version of Python use this command:
python --version
That command will tell you what version you are using. The newest vesrion of Python is Python 3.10 which was released  2021-10-04

Step 2. Installing the ChatterBot from your command line or terminal by using this command:

pip install chatterbot 

Step 3. This step is going to be different depending on what type of IDE you are using for Python. For PyCharm you are going to want to select file, navigate to settings, select Python Interrupter, and select add the plus sign. Once you have done that search for chatterbot and chatterbot-corpus add both.
